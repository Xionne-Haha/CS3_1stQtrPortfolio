**Give 1-3 key points from the SONA 2025 that you found weird, for some reason**
1. The Chief PNP challenged for the boxing ring but it was made into a joke by President Marcos as a new champion
2. People are asking whether the 20 Pesos per kilo of rice is really possible without causing losses to farmers.

**Write 2 Paragraphs of reflection**
* Sona 2025 has been pleasant, mainly because it is the very first State of Nation Affairs that I actually witnessed. As of right now, our President Ferdinand "Bong Bong" Marcos has brought up some good points and good news to the people of the Philippines. He has actually acknowledged some of the faults that the Government had, one of which was mainly the corruption that politicians possessed. He listened to the people's complaints and from what I heard from my parents, was actually a really good accomplishment.

* My parents have always mentioned that having a sense of awareness and accountability is the first step to change. After all, how can you change something if you don't know the problem, right? According to President Bong Bong Marcos, "Change cannot be accomplished by one person only but rather, it can only be accomplished if the people unite for it."

**What phrase or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025**
* According to the President himself, "We are not building for today, we are building for tomorrow."
